# NNexplore
Exploring Neural Nets in Audio context to familiarize with DSP concepts; multi-class genre classification problem with 10 labels.

Hands-on exploration of DL + DSP concepts
This repo includes code (switch to master branch) - explores fundamentals of neurons and neural networks by implementing MLP from scratch - understanding Tensorflow to replicate the above - basics of DSP/audio processing relevant for prepping datasets for deep learning, - solving genre classification using various Neural Net architectures - understanding nuances involved in improving model performance and keeping the models interpretable

The code is indexed from 0. Some of it is standalone, while some build on the previous index.
