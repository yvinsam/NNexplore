# NNexplore
Exploring Neural Nets in Audio context to familiarize with DSP concepts by working through the multi-class genre classification problem using 10 genres/labels.

This repo includes code (switch to master branch) 

- explores fundamentals of neurons and neural networks by implementing MLP from scratch 

- understanding Tensorflow to replicate the above 

- basics of DSP/audio processing relevant for prepping datasets for deep learning, 

- solving genre classification using various Neural Net architectures 

- understanding nuances involved in improving model performance and keeping the models interpretable

The code is indexed from 0. Some of it is standalone, while some build on the previous index.
