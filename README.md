### Hands-on exploration of DL + DSP concepts
- This code starts by exploring neural networks, basics of DSP as needed to create datasets for deep learning, and solving some basic problems in audio AI such as genre classification.
- The code is indexed from 0 and typically either explains a concept or builds on the previous to create an architecture
