### Hands-on exploration of DL + DSP concepts
- This repo includes code that:
    -- explores fundamentals of neurons and neural networks by implementing MLP from scratch
    -- understanding Tensorflow to replicate the above
    -- basics of DSP/audio processing relevant for prepping datasets for deep learning, 
    -- solving genre classification using various Neural Net architectures
    -- understanding nuances involved in improving model performance and keeping the models interpretable
    
- The code is indexed from 0. Some of it is standalone, while some build on the previous index.
